# Project Overview

This repository contains two separate modules: **Project-Copy** and **Demo**, which together form a complete application. Below is a detailed description of each module:

---

## **Project-Copy** (Frontend)
The **frontend** of the application is implemented using **Next.js**, a powerful React framework for server-rendered and statically-generated web applications. It provides a seamless user experience and interacts with the backend through REST APIs.

### Features
- Built using Next.js for efficient and scalable UI rendering.
- Provides dynamic routing and SSR/CSR capabilities.
- Communicates with the backend for data operations.

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules (if applicable)

### Setup Instructions
1. Navigate to the `project-copy` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## **Demo** (Backend)
The **backend** is implemented using **Spring Boot**, a powerful framework for creating production-ready Java applications. It serves as the API layer and handles the business logic and data persistence.

### Features
- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.
- Spring Boot's dependency injection for modular design.
- Uses an integrated database for data storage (MySQL).

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Language**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL 

### Setup Instructions
1. Navigate to the `demo` directory.
2. Build the project using Maven or Gradle:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
4. The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### API Documentation
- API endpoints are exposed for frontend integration. Swagger documentation (if enabled) can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

---

## Integration
- The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs. Update the API base URL in the frontend code to point to the backend:
  ```js
  const api = "http://localhost:8080/api";
  ```

---

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project.git
   ```
2. Follow the setup instructions for both **Project-Copy** and **Demo**.
3. Run both modules simultaneously for a fully functional application.
